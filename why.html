<p>Why choose Edutech?

Uncertain and indecisive of your destiny? Then you’re at the right place.
We’ll help you get your dream school with a tailored and bespoke service. The unique experience that we will provide is unmatched by our competitors and has an accuracy rate of 99%*
Our unique algorithm has been designed to allow our team of educational experts to assess your cognitive thought processes and then match you with the perfect university based on your academic and also interpersonal competencies. 
From feedback we have collated over the years, we realised that most people suffered from indecisiveness about which university to opt for as well as lack of prior knowledge on the course they were applying for.
Consequently, as a result of a lack of transparency offered by universities, 49% of students left their degree without completion or dropped out in the first 3 weeks of the semester. We are here to ensure that students start their degrees feeling confident, committed and motivated throughout.
We want you to open your mind to both the academic and social experiences that university life has to offer.</p>
